new Slack channels every time there is a new contact created
Creating new Slack channels every time there is a new contact created in Zoho CRM, and then automating the assignment of staff and invitations to the channel, can streamline communication and collaboration. Here are the steps to achieve this:

Step 1: Contact Creation in Zoho CRM            

A new contact is created in Zoho CRM under the Customer layout.

Step 2: Manual Action - Assign Staff

Your team manager manually assigns two staff members to handle this contact. This is done using CRM user lookup fields, specifically the Placement Manager and Partnership Specialist fields.

Step 3: Automation - Create Slack Channel

Implement an automation system that monitors for new contacts created in Zoho CRM.

Step 4: Automation - Assign Staff

When a new contact is created, the automation system identifies the Placement Manager and Partnership Specialist assigned to this contact in Zoho CRM.

Step 5: Automation - Create Slack Channel

The automation system then triggers the creation of a new Slack channel for this contact. The channel's name can be based on the contact's details or a predefined naming convention.

Step 6: Automation - Invite Staff to Slack Channel

After the Slack channel is created, the Placement Manager and Partnership Specialist are automatically invited to this channel. They will receive notifications and access to collaborate on this specific contact within Slack.

Step 7: Communication and Collaboration

The staff members can now use this dedicated Slack channel to communicate, share updates, and collaborate effectively on tasks related to the specific contact created in Zoho CRM.
